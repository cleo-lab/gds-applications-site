# Final projects

An large part of this course is the final project which provides an opportunity to explore a particular topic of interest using some of the skills developed in this course.  The rough schedule for carrying out the project is as follows:

* **Week 5**: Discuss project ideas with peers and instructors, submit a short summary of a project idea on Slack. 


* **Week 6**: Form teams, create GitHub repo, and provide some basic info about project as a `README.md`. 


* **Week 8**: Provide informal update to instructors, ensure data has been accessed, goals are accomplishable.


* **Week 10**: Present project to class and submit write-up by the end of the week.


Students can work independently but we encourage you to consider working as group of two or three. Teams can achieve more collectively and it will provide real-world experience with collaborative development on GitHub. There are several options for choosing a project topic:

* Propose a new research question that you have been interested in for a while but never had the chance to investigate. Hopefully some of the concepts we’ve covered in class will help you carry out the project.


* If you’re already engaged in independent research, propose a project that will move that work forward.


* Explore a side project that is related to your independent research.


* Join forces with others in the class who already have a project idea.


* If independent research is new to you or you are still struggling, talk to the instructor or grad students in the class to define a suitable final project.

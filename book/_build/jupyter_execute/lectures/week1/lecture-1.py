# ## Python
# 
# * Popular high-level programming language
# 
# 
# * Easy-to-read
# 
# 
# * Extensive and mature libraries (or packages)
# 
# 
# * Free and open-source
#     * Accessible
#     * Can be examined, modified, and improved
# 
# 
# * Constantly evolving

# ## Version control
# 
# ### Git
# * Version control software for tracking changes to a set of files
#     
# ```{image} images/git.png

# ```
# 
# ### GitHub
# * A cloud-based Git repository hosting service
# 
# 
# * Makes it easier to coordinate work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development
# 
# 
# 
# ```{image} images/github.png
# :width: 100px
# :align: center
# ```
# 
# * Python and projects that use Python (e.g. `matplotlib`) are all maintained and developed by a community of scientists and programmers on GitHub
# 
# 
# * An active, up-to-date GitHub profile, with contributions to open-source project is a great way to provide evidence of skills

# ## Course evaluation
# 
# * Lab assignments (**45%**) due every **Wednesday 11:59 pm**
# 
# 
# * Final project (**45%**) 
#     * Presentations due May 31, 11:59 pm
#     * Write-ups due June 6, 11:59pm
# 
# 
# * Participation (**10%**)
#     * Credit can be earned through attendance in lectures, visiting Professor and GE during office hours, and helping other students in labs. 

# ## Final project
# 
# * An opportunity to explore a particular topic of interest using some of the skills developed in this course
# 
# 
# * Students can work independently or in groups of two or three
# 
# 
# * Sharing of project ideas is encouraged so we can form teams

# ## Final project schedule
# 
# * **Week 5**: Discuss project ideas with peers and instructors, submit a short summary of a project idea via Canvas
# 
# 
# * **Week 6**: Form teams, create GitHub repo, and provide some basic info about project as a [README.md](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes)
# 
# 
# * **Week 8**: Provide informal update to instructors, ensure data has been accessed, goals are accomplishable
# 
# 
# * **Week 10**: Present project to class and submit write-up by the end of the week

# ## Some course themes
# 
# ### Everything is open-source
#    * All software we use is freely available
#    
#    
#    * Labs can be completed anytime, anywhere from any OS
#    
#    
#    * Course materials are publicly-available on the internet 
#

# ### Promote collaboration and communication
# 
# * With instructors and peers
# 
# 
# * On GitHub
#

# ### Learn about environmental challenges in the Western US
# 
# 
# * Urban planning
# 
# 
# * Hazards (e.g. wildfires, flooding)
# 
# 
# * Energy
# 
# 
# * Climate, hydrology, glaciology

# ## Tips for success
# 
# * Donâ€™t try and write perfect code - if it works, it works
# 
# 
# * It's not always necessary to write code, adapting code is quite normal
# 
# 
# * Make use of stackoverflow
# 
# 
# * Don't be afraid to ask (peers or instructors)
#

# * Take responsibility for learning
# 
# 
# * Organize your files
# 
# 
# * Check Canvas regularly
# 
# 
# * Maintain your GitHub profile and repository

# ## Learning outcomes
# 
# * Have confidence using Python specifically for GIS and other geospatial data science applications. In doing so, you will also be comfortable using Python for other things as well
# 
# 
# * Be able to download, process, analyze, and visualize the main types of geospatial data
# 
# 
# * Automate boring GIS tasks (no more clicking!)

# * Improve programming skills
# 
# 
# * Learn how think computationally and statistically
# 
# 
# * Solve real-world problems using spatial analysis
# 
# 
# * Run basic machine learning models
# 
# 
# * Manage a data science project using version control
# 
# 
# * Collaboratively develop a data science project
# 
# 
# * Communicate results of data science project orally and as a short write-up

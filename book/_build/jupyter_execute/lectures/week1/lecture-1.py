# ## Python
# 
# * Popular high-level programming language
# 
# 
# * Easy-to-read
# 
# 
# * Extensive and mature libraries (or packages)
# 
# 
# * Free and open-source
#     * Accessible
#     * Can be examined, modified, and improved
# 
# 
# * Constantly evolving
#

# ## Version control
# 
# ### Git
# * Version control software for tracking changes to a set of files
#     
# <img src="images/git.png" width="150"/>
# 
# ### GitHub
# * A cloud-based Git repository hosting service
# 
# 
# * Makes it easier to coordinate work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development
# 
# 
# 
# <img src="images/github.png" width="100"/>
# 
# * Python and projects that use Python (e.g. `matplotlib`) are all maintained and developed by a community of scientists and programmers on GitHub
# 
# 
# * An active, up-to-date GitHub profile, with contributions to open-source project is a great way to provide evidence of skills  

# ## Course schedule
# 
# ### Lectures
# 
# * Monday 2 pm
# 
#     * Eight lectures
#     
#     * Holiday on Jan 16
# 
# ### Labs
# 
# * Friday @ 10am or noon in MCK 442
# 
#     * Seven labs
#

# ## Course evaluation
# 
# * Lab assignments (**45%**) due every **Friday 11:59 pm**
# 
# 
# * Final project (**45%**) 
#     * Presentation due March 13, 11:59 pm
#     * Write-ups due March 17, 11:59pm
# 
# 
# * Participation (**10%**)
#     * Credit can be earned through attendance in lectures, participation in class discussion (both virtual and in-person), visiting Professor and GE during office hours, and helping other students in labs. 

# ## Final project
# 
# * An opportunity to explore a particular topic of interest using some of the skills developed in this course
# 
# 
# * Students can work independently or in groups of two or three
# 
# 
# * Sharing of project ideas is encouraged so we can form teams

# ## Final project schedule
# 
# * **Week 5**: Discuss project ideas with peers and instructors, submit a short summary of a project idea on the #final-projects Slack channel
# 
# 
# * **Week 6**: Form teams, create GitHub repo, and provide some basic info about project as a README.md
# 
# 
# * **Week 8**: Provide informal update to instructors, ensure data has been accessed, goals are accomplishable
# 
# 
# * **Week 10**: Present project to class and submit write-up by the end of the week

# ## Some course themes
# 
# ### Everything is open-source
#    * All software we use is freely available
#    
#    
#    * Labs can be completed anytime, anywhere from any OS
#    
#    
#    * Course materials are publicly-available on the internet 
#     
# <img src="images/os.png" width="600"/>

# ### Promote collaboration and communication
# 
# * With instructors and peers
# 
# 
# * On GitHub
# 
# <img src="images/collab.png" width="600"/>

# ### Learn about environmental challenges in the Western US
# 
# 
# * Urban planning
# 
# 
# * Hazards (e.g. wildfires, flooding)
# 
# 
# * Energy
# 
# 
# * Climate, hydrology, glaciology
# 
# <img src="images/environment.png" width="1000"/>

# ## Tips for success
# 
# * Don’t try and write perfect code - if it works, it works
# 
# 
# * It's not always necessary to write code, adapting code is quite normal
# 
# 
# * Make use of stackoverflow
# 
# 
# * Don't be afraid to ask (peers or instructors)
#

# * Take responsibility for learning
# 
# 
# * Organize your files
# 
# 
# * Check Canvas regularly
# 
# 
# * Maintain your GitHub profile and repository

# 
# * Have confidence using Python specifically for GIS and other geospatial data science applications. In doing so, you will also be comfortable using Python for other things as well
# 
# 
# * Be able to download, process, analyze, and visualize the main types of geospatial data
# 
# 
# * Automate boring GIS tasks (no more clicking!)

# * Improve programming skills
# 
# 
# * Learn how think computationally and statistically
# 
# 
# * Solve real-world problems using spatial analysis
# 
# 
# * Run basic machine learning models

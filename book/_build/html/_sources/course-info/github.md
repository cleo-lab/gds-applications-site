# GitHub

In this course we will use GitHub and GitHub Classrooms to complete assignments, share code, and collaborate on class projects. 

## Sign-up for an account

If you already have a GitHub account, you can skip this step. If not, create a new GitHub account using your `@uoregon.edu` email address [here](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home). We recommend that you apply for the free "edu" account upgrade (https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new) which will allow you to create unlimited number of private repos with unlimited collaborators.

## Install `git`

There are two options for installing `git`, the command line tool and the graphical user interface (GUI) called GitHub Desktop. Most students prefer **GitHub Desktop** which can be downloaded [here](https://desktop.github.com/). But, if you are comfortable with the command line, `git` can also be installed following [these instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

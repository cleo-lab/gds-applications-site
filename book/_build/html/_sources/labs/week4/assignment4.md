*****************************

## Task 1 (5 points)

Download the data for the assignment from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/znf06otczn3u79r/usa_t2m_tcc_2020.nc?dl=0). The dataset contains gridded air temperature (K) and cloud cover (%) over the USA for 2020 at 6-hour interval. `t2m` stands for 2 m above the surface, the standard height used by temperature sensors. It is a common metric used in climatology but note that it is different from the **surface** temperature which would be the temperature of the ground surface. 

Read the dataset and answer the following questions:

* a) What are the dimensions of the dataset?

* b) What was the **mean** air temperature (in F) and cloud cover (in %) of Eugene?

* c) What day was the hottest and coldest in Eugene? 

* d) What day was the hottest and coldest in Florence, OR? 
 
* e) Make a plot showing air temperature for Eugene and Florence.

*****************************

## Task 2 (5 points)

* Resample the data to **daily frequency** and report the the mean, minimum, and maximum air temperature and cloud cover for **five** location of your choice. 

*****************************

## Task 3 (5 points)

In the daily frequency dataset, find the following grid cells and provide the lat/lons **and** a rough location of where they are located.

* a) Highest annual mean air temperature (i.e. hottest place)

* b) Lowest annual mean air temperature (i.e. coldest place)

* c) Highest annual mean cloudiness (i.e. cloudiest place)

* d) Lowest annual mean cloudiest (i.e. least cloudy place)

* e) Highest **range** in air temperature

```{note}
Copy and paste the lat/lons into Google Maps to find the location of these places.
```

*****************************

## Task 4 (5 points)

Answer the following questions in the daily frequency dataset:

* a) What was the mean air temperature (in F) and cloud cover (in %) in Florence, OR in **February**?

* b) What was the air temperature (in F) and cloud cover (in %) in Phoenix, AZ on **July 16**?

* c) What was the mean air temperature (in F) and cloud cover (in %) in San Francisco, CA in **Summer** (i.e. Jun, Jul, and Aug)?

* d) What was the mean air temperature (in F) and cloud cover (in %) in Bozeman, MT between **Dec 16 and 24**?

* e) What was the mean air temperature (in F) and cloud cover (in %) in Las Vegas, NV in **Fall** (i.e. Oct, Sep, Nov)?
